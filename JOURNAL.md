# May 29th: Learn how to use CAD software.

I found a CAD software called FreeCAD, and I spend some time learning it through [a Youtube tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jULWgMV9_TM&ab_channel=CADCAMLessons) and reading the docs.

# May 30th: Learn how to design a PCB.

Really, like I learn PCB design the first time, and I'm really hoping I could get used to it.
So, I watch a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E5REDAQk_A&ab_channel=ElectronicswithEmrys) on youtube and on [hackpack guide](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide). Using KiCad is actually easier then I thought.

here's a sample uploaded to jlcpcb.com

Overall, it's still pretty fun to try all these thing that I could have never try living in this environment. Hope the project could go off without a hitch.
