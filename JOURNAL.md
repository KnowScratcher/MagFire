# May 29th: Learn how to use CAD software.

I found a CAD software called FreeCAD, and I spend some time learning it through [a Youtube tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jULWgMV9_TM&ab_channel=CADCAMLessons) and reading the docs.

# May 30th: Learn how to design a PCB.

Really, like I learn PCB design the first time, and I'm really hoping I could get used to it.
So, I watch a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E5REDAQk_A&ab_channel=ElectronicswithEmrys) on youtube and on [hackpack guide](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide). Using KiCad is actually easier then I thought.

here's a sample uploaded to jlcpcb.com

Overall, it's still pretty fun to try all these thing that I could have never try living in this environment. Hope the project could go off without a hitch.

# June 1st: Do some research

So today I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH6ensqVQTw&ab_channel=%E4%BD%91%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86) that kinda make some ideas for me, but the main thing is that it uses a 450v 650uF capacitor, and I definitely have to worry about that cus I don't really work with full "circuiting" much, so I'm thinking whether the PCB I might design later will burn out of something.

Then I took out my physics book and start turning the pages and noticed that I don't understand any equation at all.

Therefore instead of working with equations (which I might ask for my physics teacher for some help), I ask Gemini for help on impulse circuit and how to charge the capacitor.

Then it gave me this.(which doesn't work)

Well, it sure doesn't work when I open [Falstad circuit](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).
So I just try to design my own, and to my surprise, I think I did a great job.
